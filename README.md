# BBBId To Friend Code

This is a small python script/executable for retrieving a friend code from a BBBId, MSM stuff y'know 

Kinda useless now because I ported it to MSM, but it's still cool. Plus, the MSM one is 108 lines of code for just the math and for this its 2. XMLs are limited.

Made with PyCharm, exe made with PyInstaller
